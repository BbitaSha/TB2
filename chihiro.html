		<h4>My Thoughts</h4>
		<p>So, <strong>"Spirited Away"</strong> is one of the most well known Ghibli movies. It has won an Oscar. It's a big deal. We get it. <em>But do we, though?</em></p>
		<p> The world building for this movie is incredible! I just want to live in the spirit world and sit on the balcony of the bath house and look over the ocean while eating a big ole bread roll!</p>

	<div class="box-1">
		<p> It is heart-warming and heart-breaking, and I absolutely love it! I love that there aren't any real villains, that the bad guys are all kind of okay in the end. I don't know if that's the most realistic world view, but it's nice, and it makes sense in the context of the movie.</p>

	<div class="box-1">
		<p> I also love that Chihiro doesn't have any special powers or anything of that kind. She's a normal, regular girl who's kind of average at most things, because she's still a kid, and that's what kids are like!</p>
		<p> How great! What a lovely story! What a perfectly appreciated movie! Can you believe it? A good movie being recognized for being a good movie? Sensational!</p>
