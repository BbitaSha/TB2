		<h4>My Thoughts</h4>
		<p><strong>"Kiki's Deliver Service"</strong> just had to be the first one I write about. I don't know whether I would be brave enough to say that it's my favorite Ghibli movie, but it's definitely one of my all time faves. You know...just like the rest of these. But there's something special about this one.</p>

		<p>Here's the thing: I always thought of this one as a very chill, cute story. But the older I get, the more emotional I get while watching it. It deals so beautifully with what it means to try and create your own life in a new place, with what it means to feel depressed, and with what it means to get better. Things never return to what they used to be like. They're different, and maybe that's a little sad, but it's part of growing up. And that's what this movie is about.</p>

		<p>I also just really love the world that Ghibli has created for this project. I say this about every single Ghibli movie, but this one? Boy, do I mean it. Everything is so cute and aesthetically pleasing and peaceful. I just want to be a witch in training and work at a little bakery and live by the sea! The score could make me cry. Each scene is a gift. How great!</p>

		<p>Ursula is one of my favorite characters (even though I love all of them (obviously)). She lives the perfect life. She's an artist who lives in a little cabin in the woods. Sometimes she hitchhikes into town to go shopping, but most days she's painting and drawing and enjoying her quiet little life. She helps Kiki in the best ways, and I love that Kiki gets to have a best friend who's able to help her. Even though the movie hints at a love interest, it's Ursula who helps Kiki grow as a person. Their friendship is something so very precious, and I love that Ghibli took the time (once again) to emphasize the importance of friendships!</p>
