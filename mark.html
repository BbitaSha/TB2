		<p><strong>"On Your Mark"</strong> might just be a short music video, but it is gorgeous! The story is adorable. The animation is beautiful. What else do you need me to tell you? Also, have I mentioned there's a little angel girl involved? Because there is! And she has wings and can fly! And these two guys come to her rescue and set her free, and I love it!</p>

		<p>Look at her...so free, so happy... We sould all aspire to be more like her! Also the short green hair? What a look! How cute!</p>
		<p> This is one of the first films I watched when I was trying to watch every single thing that Ghibli has ever produced. It holds a special place in my heart, and it's really good! Like all the othere things on this website! WOW!</p>
