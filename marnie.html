		<h4>My Thoughts</h4>
		<p>When the trailer for <strong>"When Marnie Was There"</strong>it was getting a lot of attention from the lgbtq+ community. Everyone thought it would be a lesbian love story. Trust me, I would've been as happy as everyone else, but I just knew that it wouldn't happen. I didn't really think that one of Japan's biggest production companies would do something so progressive, especially when considering Japan's mainstream culture. When the movie finally came out and people started to understand that it wasn't a romantic love story, the hype died down, and no one really continued to talk about it.</p>

		<p>Even though I think that an lgbtq+ story would have been great, I still love this movie for what it is. Story wise, this one might be the weakest movie out of this whole list, but it's still on of my favorites. Anna's journey is so interesting to watch. Also, the animation is super crisp and clean. A lot of the movies on this list were made in the 90s/late 80s/early 2000s, and they do look beautiul in their own, faded, kind of way. But here, each scene is brimming with vibrant colors. It's sad and hopeful and it's a coming of age story. So...there's only good things. </p>
