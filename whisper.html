		<h4>My Thoughts</h4>
		<p>This is another one that's very near and dear to my heart. You probably get the concept of this website by now, but I still feel like I need to emphasize how much I love each of these movies!</p>

		<p>Listen...I'm just a sucker for stories about finding your own path and making your dreams come true and growing up. I love it! Once again, I just love that Shizuku is a regular girl who isn't really great at anything yet. She's just very passionate and loves books. This is also one of the only Ghibli movies that introduces the audience to the main character's family, and it just further highlights Shizukus situation.</p>

		<p>Of course, I also love the world of <strong>"Whisper of the Heart"</strong>. I love how Ghibli movies portray their character's lives. It makes everything feel so small and so warm. I love that they think that the story of a normal school girl is one worthy of telling and sharing with an audience. Many of these aren't the action and fantasy packed Ghibli movies that are most loved by audiences, but they're so special. They make you feel like the world is a small and okay place, and I enjoy feeling like that every once in a while, at least for a little bit.</p>
