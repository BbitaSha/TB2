	<h4>My Thoughts</h4>
	<p>There's so much to say about <strong>"From Up on Poppy Hill"</strong>. Maybe I should start with the fact that there was one time where I watched it 3 days in a row. There's just something so special about this story that takes place in 1960's Yokohama, Japan. There's also a clear theme with all of these movies. They're all coming of age stories. You got me. I'm guilty. Take me away, officer! </p>

		<p>Look at this scene! Goddamn brilliant!</p>
		<p>This is one of the two romantic love stories on this list. I'm not a big fan of romance, but this movie, as cliche as it might be, just does it in such a heart warming way. Even my cold, crule soul turns a lighter shade of grey when I watch this. I love how the school kids are exactly that: school kids. They're caricatures of grown-ups, and it's so cute to watch. </p>

		<p>This is one of my favorite parts of the movie - the club house. It's so detailed. Whenever I watch this movie I wish I could go and explore each room of the building. Once again, the movie presents a small, normal life to the audience, but it's so satisfying to watch. Please watch this one in the only way that is right - by watching it 3 days in a row. You're welcome.</p>
